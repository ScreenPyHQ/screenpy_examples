# ScreenPy Appium

The suites in this directory
have examples of using [ScreenPy Appium](https://github.com/ScreenPyHQ/screenpy_appium)
to perform automated tests
against mobile apps.

For all of these,
you will need to have Appium installed.
You can find the instructions for this
in [Appium's documentation.](https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/?lang=en#installing-appium)
